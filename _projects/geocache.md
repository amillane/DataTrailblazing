# Geocache: What is it? 
Geocaching is the world’s largest treasure hunt. The first geocache was hidden on May 3rd, 2000 and
since then over 3 million more geocaches have been hidden across 191 different countries and all 7
continents. There are over 300,000 cache owners in the world. In 2020 a geocache tagged along for a
ride to Mars with NASA’s Perseverance rover and landed in the Jezero Crater in early 2021, marking
the first interplanetary geocache. With such a buzz about geocaching, it is only natural to wonder what
makes a good geocache.

No two geocaches are the same. Some are placed in difficult-to-reach places (see the geocache on
Mars above), others are easy to get to but craftily hidden. A cache’s “Terrain” rating indicates the
physical effort that will be needed to get to the cache while a cache’s “Difficulty” rating indicates the
amount of effort that will go into solving or finding the cache. Some geocaches are as large as a boulder,
others are as small as a thimble. When a geocacher finds a geocache they have the option to grant that
cache a “favorite”, similar to a “like” on social media. The goal of our analysis is to determine whether
a cache’s Terrain or Difficulty rating affects the number of favorites it receives.
