Hello! My name is Drew Millane, and I am a statistician and data science enthusiast at heart.

## Why Statistics?
I love exploring data and uncovering the stories it tells. There’s nothing more exciting than being a detective or a trailblazer, you might say. Ever since high school, I've been passionate about how statistics can benefit so many aspects of our lives, and I knew I wanted to be part of that. In college, I’ve grown to enjoy statistical modeling and predictive analytics through my courses and research in the department.

## Why the Blog?
I want to share my excitement with fellow curious minds who are eager to learn. This website is built around the idea of collecting topics that fascinate me and deepening my understanding by sharing them with you.

## Trailblaze 
Get ready to explore with me in the frontier of data science and statistics!
